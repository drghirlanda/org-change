Let's check special LaTeX characters: [[change:][11% is an addition]].

* Replaced text in [[change:the text][a header]]

Replaced text in [[change:a header][regular text]].

[[change:][An addition with a comment**This is a comment**]]

[[change:Deleted text][✗]]

[[change:][Let's see if *org mode markup* and \LaTeX commands keep being recognized: \(a=1\).]]

New text
 
[[change:Replace this][Replacement]]

[[change:Delete this][✗]]

[[change:][pippo]]

[[change:old][pippo]]

[[change:pippo][✗]]

This is to test accept [[change:only][and reject]] in a region with [[change:one change][multiple changes]].
